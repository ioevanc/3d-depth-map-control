   - Result: All parameter changes now trigger preview updates correctly

2. **Improved Visual Feedback**
   - Added overlay on DepthMapViewer during preview generation
   - Shows circular progress with "Generating preview..." message
   - Added parameter-specific messages (e.g., "Applying Blur...")
   - Made progress bar thinner and more subtle

3. **Fixed Apply Parameters with Previous Files**
   - Created new `handleReprocess` function for reprocessing with parameters
   - Now properly fetches original image and applies new parameters
