# Session 9 Summary - Database Integration and Authentication
Date: July 20, 2025, 5:10 PM UTC

## Summary of Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Critical Production Bugs
- **OpenCV Blur Error**: Fixed kernel size assertion error when blur_amount is 0 by setting minimum kernel size to 3
- **Time Display Bug**: Fixed incorrect "time ago" display in file browser by adding timezone awareness to timestamps
- **Apply Parameters 422 Error**: Fixed FormData field name mismatch (changed from 'file' to 'image')
- **React Error Handling**: Improved error message extraction from different API response formats

### 2. Enhanced User Experience
- **Progress Percentage**: Added real-time percentage display during preview generation
  - Shows in both DepthMapControls header and DepthMapViewer overlay
  - Smooth animation from 0-90% with completion at 100%
  - Displays "Applying [Parameter]... X%" for clarity

### 3. Database and Authentication Implementation
- **MySQL Database Setup**:
  - Connected to database: three-3d (user: three-3d)
  - Created tables: users, projects, project_files
  - Implemented proper connection pooling with SQLAlchemy
  
- **Authentication System**:
  - Implemented bcrypt password hashing for security
  - JWT token authentication with 24-hour expiry
  - Created admin user: tomc@glassogroup.com
  - OAuth2 password bearer scheme for API protection

- **API Endpoints Created**:
  - POST /register - User registration
  - POST /token - OAuth2 compatible login
  - POST /login - JSON-based login alternative
  - GET /users/me - Current user information
  - GET /users - List all users (admin only)
  - GET /projects - List user projects
  - GET /projects/{id} - Get specific project
  - PUT /projects/{id} - Update project
  - DELETE /projects/{id} - Delete project

## Errors Encountered and Resolutions

1. **Database Connection Error**: Initial credentials (threed-db) were incorrect
   - Resolution: Updated to correct credentials (three-3d / DV5Lg9IMz7SfFilCzu0h)

2. **Import Issues**: Missing optional authentication dependency
   - Resolution: Created get_current_user_optional function for endpoints that support both authenticated and anonymous access

## Current System State

### Backend Status:
- Authentication system fully implemented
- Database schema created and initialized
- Admin user created and functional
- Project management endpoints ready
- Process endpoint partially updated for project saving

### Frontend Status:
- No authentication UI implemented yet
- Still operates in anonymous mode
- All existing features working correctly

### Security Implementation:
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection

## Pending Work and In-Progress Tasks

1. **Complete Process Endpoint** (In Progress):
   - Need to finish implementing project saving logic
   - Link uploaded files to project records
   - Store processing parameters with project

2. **Frontend Authentication**:
   - Create login/register components
   - Add authentication state management
   - Implement protected routes
   - Add logout functionality

3. **Project Management UI**:
   - Project listing page
   - Project details view
   - Edit project parameters
   - Delete project functionality

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - CSRF protection middleware
   - Rate limiting for auth endpoints
   - Input validation improvements

## Important Decisions and Context

1. **Database Choice**: MySQL was already provisioned, using PyMySQL driver for compatibility
2. **Auth Strategy**: JWT tokens chosen for stateless authentication, compatible with frontend
3. **Dual Mode**: System supports both authenticated (with projects) and anonymous usage
4. **File Storage**: Physical files remain on filesystem but are tracked in database

## Configuration Details

- Database: three-3d (MySQL)
- JWT Secret: Placeholder in .env (needs production value)
- Token Expiry: 1440 minutes (24 hours)
- Password: bcrypt with salt rounds

## Next Immediate Priorities

1. Complete the project saving functionality in process endpoint
2. Create React components for login/registration
3. Implement authentication context/state management
4. Add project list view to frontend
5. Test complete authentication flow
6. Update FILE-MAP.md with new files created
