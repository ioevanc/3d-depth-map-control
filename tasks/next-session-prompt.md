# Next Session Prompt - Continue 3D Depth Map Application Development

## Context
You are continuing development of a professional 3D depth map control application for crystal etching. The application converts 2D images to depth maps and DXF files.

## Current Status (as of July 20, 2025, 2:45 PM EST)
The application is fully functional with real-time preview, but there are critical issues to fix:

### Immediate Issues to Fix:
1. **Preview endpoint returning 500 errors** - Users are getting intermittent 500 errors when adjusting parameters
2. **Add percentage progress** - User specifically requested: "it would be nice to actually see percentage completed in addition to ex: Applying Blur message"
3. **Backend error details needed** - The backend logs show 500 errors but no detailed error messages

### Error Example from Console:
```
POST http://96.30.196.26:5176/api/preview 500 (Internal Server Error)
Preview generation failed: AxiosError {message: 'Request failed with status code 500'}
```

## Recent Work Completed (Session 8)
1. Fixed real-time preview parameter changes (was only working once)
2. Added visual feedback overlay on depth map during preview
3. Fixed "Apply Parameters" to work with previously loaded files
4. Simplified parameter change detection in DepthMapControls

## Architecture Overview
- Frontend: React 19 + Vite + Material-UI
- Backend: FastAPI + Depth Anything V2
- Real-time preview with 300ms debouncing
- Backend caching with 60s expiry

## First Tasks:
1. Check backend logs: `tail -n 200 /home/glassogroup-3d/htdocs/3d.glassogroup.com/backend/backend.log`
2. Look for Python tracebacks or error details around the 500 errors
3. Check the preview endpoint in `/backend/main.py` for potential issues
4. Add progress percentage tracking to preview generation
5. Test with actual parameter adjustments to reproduce the 500 error

## Key Files to Check:
- `/backend/main.py` - Preview endpoint implementation
- `/frontend/src/App.jsx` - handleParametersChange function (line ~300)
- `/frontend/src/components/DepthMapControls.jsx` - Parameter change handling
- `/frontend/src/components/DepthMapViewer.jsx` - Preview loading display

## Important Notes:
- The preview endpoint accepts JSON body with image_url and parameters
- Backend has in-memory caching that might be related to the errors
- User wants to see actual percentage progress, not just status messages
- The application is live and being tested by users

Start by investigating the 500 errors as they are blocking user functionality.
