## Review - Session 8 (July 20, 2025, 2:30 PM EST)

### Major Fixes Completed:

1. **Fixed Real-time Preview Parameter Changes**
   - Issue: Parameters only worked on first change due to faulty object reference comparison
   - Solution: Replaced `prevParametersRef` with simple `isMountedRef` to skip only initial mount
   - Result: All parameter changes now trigger preview updates correctly

2. **Improved Visual Feedback**
   - Added overlay on DepthMapViewer during preview generation
   - Shows circular progress with "Generating preview..." message
   - Added parameter-specific messages (e.g., "Applying Blur...")
   - Made progress bar thinner and more subtle

3. **Fixed Apply Parameters with Previous Files**
   - Created new `handleReprocess` function for reprocessing with parameters
   - Now properly fetches original image and applies new parameters
   - Works for both fresh uploads and previously loaded files

### Technical Changes:
- DepthMapControls.jsx: Simplified change detection, added parameter tracking
- DepthMapViewer.jsx: Added loading overlay with progress indicator
- App.jsx: Added handleReprocess function, fixed useCallback dependencies
- WorkspaceLayout.jsx: Pass previewLoading to DepthMapViewer

### Current Issues:
- Preview endpoint returning 500 errors intermittently
- Need to add percentage progress to preview loading
- Some preview requests may be failing due to backend issues

### Next Priorities:
1. Debug and fix 500 errors on preview endpoint
2. Add progress percentage to loading indicators
3. Investigate backend error handling for preview generation
4. Consider adding retry logic for failed preview requests

## Review - Session 3 (July 20, 2025, 5:30 AM EST)

### Major Fixes and Improvements:

1. **Fixed Static File Serving**
   - Updated vite.config.js to proxy /static paths to backend
   - Resolved 404 errors for depth maps and DXF files
   - All files now load correctly through the proxy

2. **Fixed DXF Parser**
   - Corrected parser to find ENTITIES section in proper DXF format
   - Fixed "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error for large point clouds
   - Implemented point sampling (50k max) for smooth rendering
   - Successfully parsing and displaying 181,889 points

3. **Added Progress Bar System**
   - Real-time progress tracking during image processing
   - Step-by-step status with visual indicators
   - Shows: Upload, AI Analysis, Depth Map Generation, DXF Creation, Finalizing

4. **Enhanced Delete Functionality**
   - Backend now deletes all related files (original, depth map, DXF) with single action
   - Frontend shows delete button in results section
   - Confirmation dialog before deletion

5. **Fixed File Browser**
   - Now saves and displays original images
   - Shows file sizes consistently in MB
   - Hides upload section when viewing previous files
   - "New Upload" button to return to upload mode

6. **Added Depth Scaling Controls**
   - Adjustable depth scale slider (0.5x to 10x)
   - Real-time 3D view updates
   - Manual input field for precise values
   - Default 2x scaling for better visibility

7. **Improved 3D Navigation**
   - Removed auto-rotation lock
   - Camera centers on point cloud
   - Free pan, zoom, and rotate controls
   - Better lighting setup

8. **Created Server Management Script**
   - restart-servers.sh kills and restarts both servers
   - Color-coded output with status checks
   - Shows helpful logs and URLs

### Technical Decisions:
- Used point sampling instead of decimation for performance
- Chose 50,000 points as optimal rendering limit
- Set default depth scale to 2x for better initial visibility
- Implemented file grouping by UUID for related files

### Current System State:
- Both servers running (Backend: 8000, Frontend: 5176)
- All features fully functional
- UI polished with modern glassmorphism design
- File management working with proper cleanup

## Review - Session 5 (July 20, 2025, 7:00 AM EST)

   - Consistent layout regardless of application state

2. **Enhanced File Management**
   - Created FileBrowserNew.jsx with grouped file display
   - Added /files/grouped backend endpoint
   - Files grouped by UUID showing all related files together
   - One-click load all related files
   - Smart file matching when loading DXF or depth map

3. **Professional Depth Map Controls**
   - Added DepthMapControls.jsx with professional parameters
   - Blur, contrast, brightness, edge enhancement, invert depth
   - Presets: Portrait, Landscape, Text/Logo, Fine Detail
   - Real-time preview system with debouncing

   - Created comprehensive .gitignore
   - Initial commit with all project files
   - Created GitHub repo: https://github.com/ioevanc/3d-depth-map-control
   - Successfully pushed to remote

### Issues Encountered:
- Fade component prop type warnings (fixed with boolean conversion)
- Canvas2D performance warning (fixed with willReadFrequently)
- Preview endpoint 422 errors (fixed by using Pydantic model)
- Git ownership issues (resolved with safe.directory)
- Application hanging (possibly due to too many preview requests)

### Current State:
- Three-panel layout working
- File browser groups files intelligently
- Controls always visible with disabled state when no data
- Preview endpoint working but may need rate limiting
- All original functionality preserved
