# Session 13 Summary
Date: July 20, 2025, 7:00 PM UTC

## Summary of Completed Tasks

### 1. Background Threshold Feature Implementation
- **Added backend support**: New `background_threshold` parameter in DepthMapParams model
- **Updated depth_map_to_dxf function**: Now accepts original_image_path to check darkness in original image
- **Database migration**: Created add_background_threshold.py script and added column to projects table
- **Frontend UI**: Added threshold slider (0-255) in DepthMapControls component
- **Visual feedback**: Preview shows areas that will be excluded (checkerboard pattern)
- **Updated all presets**: Default (10), Portrait (10), Landscape (10), Text/Logo (20), Fine Detail (15)

### 2. DXF Upload Feature
- **Backend endpoint**: Created `/upload-dxf` that accepts DXF files, validates, and analyzes them
- **Analysis tool**: Created analyze_dxf.py standalone script for DXF format analysis
- **Frontend component**: Created DXFUpload.jsx with drag & drop functionality
- **UI integration**: Added "DXF" tab to WorkspaceLayout (with purple icon)
- **Auto-loading**: Uploaded DXF files automatically load in the 3D viewer

### 3. Server Management Improvements
- **Individual scripts**: Created start-backend.sh and start-frontend.sh
- **Improved restart**: Created restart-servers-new.sh that uses individual scripts
- **Better feedback**: Scripts now show immediate status instead of waiting forever

### 4. Documentation Updates
- **Created IMAGE-PREPARATION-GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive guide for preparing images
- **Updated FILE-MAP.md**: Added all new files and components

## Errors Encountered and Resolutions

1. **500 Error on /process endpoint**
   - Issue: Passing undefined `output_path` to depth_map_to_dxf
   - Resolution: Changed to pass `original_path` instead

2. **Server startup timing issues**
   - Issue: restart-servers.sh would wait indefinitely
   - Resolution: Created separate scripts with proper PID tracking

3. **Tab panel indices**
   - Issue: Added new DXF tab but didn't update indices
   - Resolution: Updated Projects tab to index 3 (was 2)

## Current State of the System

- **Backend**: Running on port 8000 with all features operational
- **Frontend**: Running on port 5176 with new DXF upload tab
- **Database**: Updated schema includes background_threshold column
- **Features working**:
  - User authentication and project saving
  - Background threshold excludes black areas correctly
  - DXF upload ready for testing
  - All processing parameters functional

## Pending Work

1. **DXF Format Analysis**: Need to analyze the other company's DXF file (80x50x50_ver_lisa_busby_01_export.dxf)
2. **Format Comparison**: Compare our POINT format with Venus3D layer format
3. **Testing**: Test DXF upload feature with various files
4. **Optimization**: Consider if we need to match the exact format

## Important Decisions and Context

1. **Background Threshold Logic**: 
   - Decided to check original image darkness, not depth map
   - This matches standard laser etching workflow (white = engrave, black = exclude)

2. **DXF Format Observations**:
   - Other company uses "Venus3D" layer name
   - Points have handle IDs and owner references
   - Our format uses layer "0" (default)

3. **UI Design**:
   - DXF upload gets its own tab to avoid confusion
   - Purple icon color to differentiate from image upload

## Technical Details

### DXF Format Comparison:
**Our Format**:
- Version: AC1009 (R12)
- Entities: POINT on layer 0
- Coordinates: (x, y, z) where z is depth in mm

**Other Company Format**:
- Has HEADER section with $EXTMIN/$EXTMAX
- Points on layer "Venus3D"
- Each point has handle ID and owner reference
- Similar coordinate structure

## Next Immediate Priorities

1. Run analyze_dxf.py on the other company's file
2. Determine if we need to match their format exactly
3. Test DXF upload functionality
4. Consider adding layer name configuration
5. Test with actual laser software
