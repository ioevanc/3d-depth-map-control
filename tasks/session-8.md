# Session 8 Summary - Fixed Real-time Preview and Visual Feedback
Date: July 20, 2025, 2:30 PM EST

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Real-time Preview Not Working After First Change
**Problem**: Parameter changes only worked once due to incorrect object reference comparison.

**Solution**:
- Removed the flawed `prevParametersRef` comparison that was storing object references
- Implemented a simpler `isMountedRef` to skip only the initial mount
- Let React's dependency array handle change detection properly
- Now all parameter changes trigger preview updates correctly

### 2. Poor Visual Feedback During Preview Generation
**Problem**: Only a thin progress bar at the top of controls panel, users didn't know what was happening.

**Solution**:
- Added a full overlay on the DepthMapViewer during preview generation
- Shows circular progress spinner with informative text
- Displays "Generating preview..." with "Applying depth map adjustments"
- Added parameter-specific messages in controls (e.g., "Applying Blur...")
- Made progress bar thinner (2px) and more subtle

## Implementation Details

### DepthMapControls.jsx:
- Simplified parameter change detection with `isMountedRef`
- Added `lastChangedParam` state to track which parameter changed
- Created `getParameterDisplayName` helper for friendly names
- Shows specific messages like "Applying Contrast..." during preview
- Reduced debounce to 300ms for better responsiveness

### DepthMapViewer.jsx:
- Added `previewLoading` prop
- Shows dark overlay with blur effect during preview generation
- Displays circular progress with informative messages
- Maintains current image visible but dimmed underneath

### WorkspaceLayout.jsx:
- Passes `previewLoading` prop to DepthMapViewer

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Users now see exactly when preview is being generated
2. **Parameter-Specific Messages**: Shows which parameter is being applied
3. **Better Performance**: Reduced debounce time for more responsive feel
4. **Professional Look**: Dark overlay with blur effect looks polished

## Testing Notes
- Parameter changes now work consistently for all subsequent changes
- Visual feedback is clear and informative
- Preview updates are smooth and responsive
- No more issues with parameters only working once
