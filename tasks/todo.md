## Review

### Session 2 - Major Updates (July 20, 2025, 4:30 AM)

#### Completed Features:
1. **Depth Map Viewer** - Added interactive viewer with:
   - Hover functionality showing depth values in mm
   - Multiple color modes (Grayscale, Heatmap, Viridis, Plasma)
   - Real-time cursor tracking with position and depth info
   - Loading states and dimension display

2. **3D DXF Viewer** - Implemented Three.js-based viewer with:
   - Point cloud visualization with color-coded depth
   - Interactive controls (rotate, zoom, pan)
   - Statistics display (point count, bounding box)
   - Auto-rotation for better visualization
   - Progress bar for loading large files

3. **File Browser** - Added previous file management:
   - Floating action button (FAB) with history icon
   - List all converted files with metadata
   - Search functionality
   - Download and delete options
   - Independent file selection (can load depth map or DXF separately)
   - Backend endpoints: GET /files, DELETE /files/{filename}

4. **UI Redesign** - Complete modern overhaul:
   - New dark theme with purple/pink gradient accents
   - Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur
   - Rounded corners and smooth animations
   - SF Pro Display font for Apple-like aesthetics
   - Gradient backgrounds and modern card designs
   - Responsive grid layout

#### Issues Fixed:
- DOM nesting warning (removed divs from p elements)
- File browser now allows independent file loading
- Backend restart issues resolved
- UI completely modernized to match reference design

#### Remaining Issues:
- DXF parser may need adjustment for some file formats
- Original image not showing when loading files from browser
- Need to verify point cloud rendering with actual DXF files

The system now has a professional, modern UI with comprehensive file viewing and management capabilities.

## Review - Session 3 (July 20, 2025, 5:30 AM EST)

### Major Fixes and Improvements:

1. **Fixed Static File Serving**
   - Updated vite.config.js to proxy /static paths to backend
   - Resolved 404 errors for depth maps and DXF files
   - All files now load correctly through the proxy

2. **Fixed DXF Parser**
   - Corrected parser to find ENTITIES section in proper DXF format
   - Fixed "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error for large point clouds
   - Implemented point sampling (50k max) for smooth rendering
   - Successfully parsing and displaying 181,889 points

3. **Added Progress Bar System**
   - Real-time progress tracking during image processing
   - Step-by-step status with visual indicators
   - Shows: Upload, AI Analysis, Depth Map Generation, DXF Creation, Finalizing

4. **Enhanced Delete Functionality**
   - Backend now deletes all related files (original, depth map, DXF) with single action
   - Frontend shows delete button in results section
   - Confirmation dialog before deletion

5. **Fixed File Browser**
   - Now saves and displays original images
   - Shows file sizes consistently in MB
   - Hides upload section when viewing previous files
   - "New Upload" button to return to upload mode

6. **Added Depth Scaling Controls**
   - Adjustable depth scale slider (0.5x to 10x)
   - Real-time 3D view updates
   - Manual input field for precise values
   - Default 2x scaling for better visibility

7. **Improved 3D Navigation**
   - Removed auto-rotation lock
   - Camera centers on point cloud
   - Free pan, zoom, and rotate controls
   - Better lighting setup

8. **Created Server Management Script**
   - restart-servers.sh kills and restarts both servers
   - Color-coded output with status checks
   - Shows helpful logs and URLs

### Technical Decisions:
- Used point sampling instead of decimation for performance
- Chose 50,000 points as optimal rendering limit
- Set default depth scale to 2x for better initial visibility
- Implemented file grouping by UUID for related files

### Current System State:
- Both servers running (Backend: 8000, Frontend: 5176)
- All features fully functional
- UI polished with modern glassmorphism design
- File management working with proper cleanup
