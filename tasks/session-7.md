# Session 7 Summary - Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements
Date: July 20, 2025, 1:00 PM EST

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DXF Viewer Hanging Issue
**Problem**: When loading previously converted files, the DXF viewer would hang and not display the 3D model.

**Solution**:
- Changed initial loading state from `true` to `false` to prevent hanging on mount
- Added AbortController for request cancellation
- Implemented proper state reset when URL changes
- Added cleanup function to abort requests on unmount
- Fixed axios cancel detection

**Files Modified**: `/frontend/src/components/DXFViewer.jsx`

### 2. Depth Map Parameter Sliders Having No Effect
**Problem**: Adjusting the depth map control sliders was generating many duplicate requests but not showing visual changes.

**Root Cause**: The `handleParametersChange` function was being recreated on every render, causing the DepthMapControls useEffect to fire repeatedly.

**Solution**:
- Wrapped `handleParametersChange` in `useCallback` hook to memoize the function
- Removed debug console.log statements that were cluttering the console
- The preview functionality was already working correctly (backend was returning data)

**Files Modified**: 
- `/frontend/src/App.jsx`
- `/frontend/src/components/DXFViewer.jsx`

## Current Application State
- DXF viewer now loads previous files without hanging
- Depth map parameter adjustments should now work smoothly
- Reduced console logging for cleaner debugging
- Both preview generation and request cancellation working properly

## Performance Improvements
- Memoized callback prevents unnecessary re-renders
- AbortController prevents request pile-up
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

## Next Steps
1. Test the parameter sliders to ensure they update the depth map preview
2. Monitor for any remaining performance issues
3. Consider adding visual feedback when parameters are being applied
4. Implement remaining features from the todo list (histogram, comparison view, preset save/load)
