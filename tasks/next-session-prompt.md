# Next Session Prompt - Crystal Etching Converter

I need to continue working on the Crystal Etching Converter system. Here's the current state:

## Project Overview
A web-based system that converts 2D photos into depth maps and DXF files for subsurface laser etching (SSLE) in crystal blocks. It's for an awards/trophies business to replace expensive external services.

## Current Status - FULLY FUNCTIONAL
The system is complete and working with all major features:
- FastAPI backend with Depth Anything V2 for depth map generation
- DXF export with proper point cloud generation (181k+ points)
- React frontend with modern glassmorphism UI
- Interactive depth map viewer with multiple color modes
- 3D DXF point cloud viewer with depth scaling controls
- File browser with full CRUD operations
- Progress tracking during processing
- Server management script for easy restart

## All Features Working
✅ Image upload with drag-and-drop
✅ Real-time processing progress bar
✅ Depth map generation and interactive viewing
✅ DXF file creation with proper ENTITIES parsing
✅ 3D point cloud visualization (sampled to 50k points)
✅ Adjustable depth scaling (0.5x to 10x)
✅ File management (list, delete, download)
✅ Original image storage and display
✅ Modern UI with purple/pink gradients
✅ Delete functionality for all related files

## Recent Fixes (Session 3)
1. Fixed static file serving through Vite proxy
2. Fixed DXF parser for proper ENTITIES section reading
3. Fixed stack overflow with large point arrays
4. Added progress tracking with step indicators
5. Implemented file deletion with UUID grouping
6. Fixed file browser to show original images
7. Added depth scale controls for 3D effect
8. Improved 3D navigation (removed auto-rotation lock)

## Running Services
Use the restart script: `/home/glassogroup-3d/htdocs/3d.glassogroup.com/restart-servers.sh`
- Backend: http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI)
- Frontend: http://localhost:5176 (Vite)

## Key Files
- `/home/glassogroup-3d/htdocs/3d.glassogroup.com/backend/main.py` - Backend with all endpoints
- `/home/glassogroup-3d/htdocs/3d.glassogroup.com/frontend/src/components/DXFViewer.jsx` - 3D viewer with depth controls
- `/home/glassogroup-3d/htdocs/3d.glassogroup.com/frontend/src/App.jsx` - Main app with progress logic
- `/home/glassogroup-3d/htdocs/3d.glassogroup.com/tasks/session-3.md` - Latest detailed session summary
- `/home/glassogroup-3d/htdocs/3d.glassogroup.com/restart-servers.sh` - Server management script

## In Progress Task
Was adding auto-rotation toggle and camera reset button to DXFViewer.jsx:
- Added state for autoRotate
- Updated Scene component to accept autoRotate prop
- Need to add UI buttons for toggle and reset

## Next Priorities
1. Complete the auto-rotation toggle UI
2. Add camera reset button
3. Consider adding view presets (front, side, top)
4. Test with various real-world images
5. Prepare for production deployment
6. Update documentation

## Important Context
- Point cloud limited to 50k for performance
- Default depth scale is 2x for visibility
- Files grouped by UUID for related operations
- Using point sampling, not decimation
- MAX_DEPTH_MM=50 in .env (consider increasing)

Please start by checking the servers with `lsof -i :8000` and `lsof -i :5176`, then continue with the auto-rotation toggle implementation in DXFViewer.jsx.
