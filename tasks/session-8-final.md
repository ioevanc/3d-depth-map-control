# Session 8 Summary - Real-time Preview and Visual Feedback Improvements
Date: July 20, 2025, 2:45 PM EST

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Fixed Real-time Preview Parameter Changes
**Issue**: After changing one parameter, subsequent parameter changes were not triggering preview updates.
**Root Cause**: The `prevParametersRef.current = parameters` was storing object reference instead of a copy, causing comparison to always return false.
**Solution**: 
- Removed the flawed JSON.stringify comparison logic
- Implemented simple `isMountedRef` to skip only the initial mount
- Let React's dependency array handle change detection
- Added reset logic when component becomes enabled

### 2. Enhanced Visual Feedback for Preview Generation
**Implemented**:
- Full overlay on DepthMapViewer with dark background and blur effect
- Circular progress spinner with informative messages
- Parameter-specific messages in controls (e.g., "Applying Blur...")
- Thinner, more subtle progress bar (2px height)
- Added `lastChangedParam` tracking to show which parameter is being applied

### 3. Fixed "Apply Parameters" with Previous Files
**Issue**: "Apply Parameters" showed "Please select an image first" when working with previously loaded files.
**Solution**:
- Created new `handleReprocess` function that fetches the original image from URL
- Properly handles parameters for both fresh uploads and loaded files
- Updated WorkspaceLayout to use `onReprocess` when results exist

## Current System State

### Working Features:
- Real-time preview updates when adjusting any parameter
- Visual feedback shows clearly when preview is generating
- Parameter changes work consistently for all adjustments
- Apply Parameters works with both new uploads and previous files
- Professional loading overlays and progress indicators

### Known Issues:
1. **Preview endpoint returning 500 errors** - Intermittent failures need investigation
2. **No percentage progress** - User requested percentage in addition to status messages
3. **Backend error handling** - Need better error logging for preview generation

## File Changes Made

### `/frontend/src/components/DepthMapControls.jsx`:
- Replaced complex parameter comparison with simple mounted flag
- Added `lastChangedParam` state for specific messages
- Added `getParameterDisplayName` helper function
- Shows "Applying [Parameter]..." during updates

### `/frontend/src/components/DepthMapViewer.jsx`:
- Added `previewLoading` prop
- Implemented full loading overlay with CircularProgress
- Shows "Generating preview..." with backdrop blur

### `/frontend/src/App.jsx`:
- Added `handleReprocess` function for parameter application
- Fixed useCallback dependency from `[results]` to `[results?.original_url]`
- Reset preview loading state in various scenarios

### `/frontend/src/components/WorkspaceLayout.jsx`:
- Added `onReprocess` handler prop
- Pass `previewLoading` to DepthMapViewer
- Use appropriate handler based on whether results exist

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Fix 500 Errors on Preview Endpoint**:
   - Check backend logs for detailed error messages
   - Investigate if it's related to image URL access
   - Add better error handling and retry logic

2. **Add Progress Percentage**:
   - Implement progress tracking in backend preview generation
   - Show percentage alongside status messages
   - Consider estimated time remaining

3. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Add user-friendly error messages
   - Implement retry mechanism for failed previews
   - Better logging on backend for debugging

## Important Context for Next Session
- The preview functionality uses debouncing (300ms) to avoid too many requests
- The backend has caching implemented but might have issues with certain requests
- The visual feedback is working but needs percentage progress as requested
- Some users are experiencing 500 errors that need immediate attention
