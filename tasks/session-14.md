## Summary of Completed Tasks

### 1. Complete Depth Zone Editor Feature Implementation

Successfully implemented a comprehensive layer-based depth editing system:

#### Components Created:
1. **DepthZoneEditor** (`frontend/src/components/DepthZoneEditor/DepthZoneEditor.jsx`)
   - Canvas-based drawing interface
   - Rectangle and lasso selection tools
   - Zone types: 3D Depth Mapped, Flat (fixed depth), Custom depth
   - Layer management panel with visibility controls
   - Depth adjustment sliders (range: -10mm to 25mm)
   - Text detection integration

2. **CrystalPreview** (`frontend/src/components/CrystalPreview/CrystalPreview.jsx`)
   - 3D visualization using Three.js and React Three Fiber
   - Transparent crystal rendering with glass material
   - Point cloud display inside crystal
   - Crystal size presets: Small (50×50×80mm), Medium (60×60×100mm), Large (80×50×120mm)
   - Custom size input option
   - Opacity controls and view modes

3. **DXF Parser** (`frontend/src/components/CrystalPreview/parseDXF.js`)
   - Parses DXF files and extracts POINT entities
   - Handles large files with point sampling (max 50K points)
   - Debug logging for troubleshooting

#### Backend Implementation:
1. **Zone Processing Router** (`backend/routers/zones.py`)
   - `/api/zones/process-with-zones` - Processes images with depth zones
   - `/api/zones/detect-text` - Automatic text detection using edge detection
   - Applies zone masks during DXF generation
   - Supports flat depth overrides for text areas

#### Integration Updates:
- Added "Depth Zones" tab to WorkspaceLayout (index 1)
- Added "Crystal Preview" tab to right panel (index 2)
- Connected zone data flow from editor through App.jsx to backend
- Conditional endpoint selection based on zone presence
- Parse DXF files for crystal preview visualization

### 2. DXF Format Updates (from previous session)
- Changed layer name from '0' to 'Venus3D' for compatibility
- Increased point density (sampling rate = 1)
- Centered coordinates around origin
- Added mm scaling (0.1 factor)
- Support for negative Z-depths

### 3. Crystal Rendering Improvements
- Fixed point cloud visibility inside crystal
- Scaled and centered points to fit within crystal bounds
- Added glamour lighting setup with multiple light sources
- Enhanced crystal material with glass properties
- Points now use cyan color with additive blending for visibility

## Errors Encountered and Resolutions

1. **DXF Points Not Showing**
   - Issue: Points were positioned outside crystal bounds
   - Resolution: Added automatic scaling and centering based on point cloud bounds

2. **Crystal Material Not Transparent**
   - Issue: Crystal appeared as opaque box
   - Resolution: Adjusted material properties with transmission, proper opacity, and depthWrite: false

3. **Import Path Issues**
   - Issue: Module import errors for zones router
   - Resolution: Added sys.path manipulation for proper imports

## Current State of the System

- **Feature Branch**: `feature/depth-zone-editor` created and active
- **Components**: All depth zone editing components functional
- **Backend**: Zone processing endpoints integrated
- **Crystal Preview**: Shows point cloud inside transparent crystal
- **DXF Generation**: Supports zones with Venus3D layer format

## Pending Work

1. **Crystal Rendering Enhancement**
   - Current crystal still looks like a blunt box rather than glass
   - Need to match reference images (crystal1.png, crystal2.png)
   - Requires better refraction, caustics, and glass shader

2. **Background Improvement**
   - Current gradient background needs enhancement
   - Should have more dramatic/interesting gradient

3. **Zone Features**
   - Magic wand tool implementation
   - Zone templates/presets
   - Gradient depth transitions

## Important Decisions and Context

1. **Zone Processing Flow**:
   - When zones are defined, use `/api/zones/process-with-zones`
   - Otherwise use regular `/api/process` endpoint
   - Zones are sent as JSON in FormData

2. **Crystal Visualization**:
   - Points are scaled to fit within crystal with 90% margin
   - Using additive blending for point visibility through glass
   - Crystal size affects point cloud scaling

3. **DXF Compatibility**:
   - All DXF files now use Venus3D layer
   - Points centered around origin for laser software compatibility

## Next Immediate Priorities

1. Fix crystal rendering to look like actual glass/crystal
2. Implement proper glass shader with caustics
3. Enhance background with dramatic gradient
4. Test complete workflow with zones
5. Add progress indicators for zone processing

## Technical Notes

- Canvas drawing uses useEffect dependencies to trigger redraws
- DXF parser logs first 5 points for debugging
- Crystal material uses meshPhysicalMaterial with transmission
- Zone masks created with cv2.fillPoly in backend
