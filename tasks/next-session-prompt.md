# Next Session Prompt - Crystal Preview Refinements

## Context
You are continuing development of the Crystal Etching Converter application on the `feature/depth-zone-editor` branch. In the last session, we fixed the crystal glass rendering to be clear and transparent (not milky) and updated documentation for server management.

## Current Status (as of July 21, 2025, 9:15 PM UTC)

### What's Working:
- Crystal preview shows clear glass with proper transmission (thickness=0.01)
- Depth zone editor for layer-based editing is functional
- DXF upload and parsing works correctly
- Points display inside crystal with proper scaling
- Authentication and project management fully functional
- Background threshold excludes black areas from DXF
- Servers run in background (Backend: 8000, Frontend: 5176)

### Recent Changes:
1. Fixed milky glass appearance by reducing material thickness
2. Reverted failed attempts at beveled edges and environment changes
3. Updated documentation to emphasize background server execution

### Current Crystal Material (CrystalPreview.jsx):
```javascript
<meshPhysicalMaterial
  color={0xffffff}
  transmission={transmission}
  opacity={1}
  transparent={true}
  roughness={0}
  metalness={0}
  ior={1.5}
  thickness={0.01}  // Critical for clear appearance
  specularIntensity={1}
  specularColor={0xffffff}
  envMapIntensity={1}
  clearcoat={1}
  clearcoatRoughness={0}
  side={THREE.DoubleSide}
  depthWrite={false}
/>
```

## Immediate Tasks:

1. **Improve Crystal Appearance for Product Sales**:
   - Research drei's RoundedBox component for proper beveled edges
   - Explore alternative environment presets without equipment reflections
   - Consider adding subtle post-processing (bloom effect)
   - Keep glass clear and transparent (current settings work well)

2. **Test Complete Workflow**:
   - Load an image and create depth zones
   - Process with zones and generate DXF
   - Verify crystal preview shows correct point cloud
   - Test with actual laser etching company DXF files

3. **Background Enhancement**:
   - Add subtle gradient or effects that don't interfere with glass
   - Ensure professional appearance for product visualization
   - Consider particle effects or subtle animations

## Important Notes:
- DO NOT change material thickness above 0.01 (causes milky appearance)
- Keep "studio" environment preset at 0.5 intensity
- Always run servers in background on specified ports
- The feature branch has all depth zone editor functionality
