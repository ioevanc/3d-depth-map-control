# Session 6 Summary - Application Performance Fixes
Date: July 20, 2025, 8:00 AM EST

## Issue Addressed
Application was hanging due to too many concurrent preview requests overwhelming the backend. The backend log showed many successful preview requests (200 OK) followed by multiple 500 Internal Server Error responses.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Frontend Rate Limiting (DepthMapControls.jsx)
- Added `useRef` hooks to track preview requests
- Increased debounce delay from 300ms to 500ms
- Implemented request cancellation for pending previews
- Added abort flag to prevent race conditions

### 2. Request Cancellation (App.jsx)
- Added AbortController to cancel pending axios requests
- Prevents overlapping preview requests
- Handles cancelled requests gracefully without error logging

### 3. Backend Caching (main.py)
- Implemented simple in-memory cache for preview results
- 60-second cache expiry for repeated requests
- MD5 hash-based cache keys from request parameters
- Automatic cleanup of expired cache entries

## Technical Details
- Preview requests were creating too many concurrent depth map generations
- Each slider change triggered a new preview request
- Without cancellation, requests would pile up causing server overload
- Cache prevents redundant processing of identical parameters

## Next Steps
1. Test the application to ensure smooth preview updates
2. Monitor backend logs for any remaining 500 errors
3. Consider adding progress indicator for preview generation
4. Potentially add server-side rate limiting if needed

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/DepthMapControls.jsx`
- `/frontend/src/App.jsx`
- `/backend/main.py`

The application should now handle parameter adjustments smoothly without hanging.
